/**

 * reflect the current event log.
 *
 * Manual adjustments (ScoreAdjustment rows) are merged into the timeline by
 * timestamp, so a coach's correction survives subsequent undo/delete —
 * previously recalculation replayed events only and silently discarded them.
 *
 * NOTE: this is only valid while score state is fully DERIVED from the
 * timeline. A match under manual override (see applyEventRemoval) has set
 * boundaries no replay can reproduce, so callers must not use this on one.

/**
 * Brings match score state back in line after an event is undone or deleted.
 *
 * Normally that means a full replay. But once a coach has used a manual set
 * operation (End Set / Undo Set / Reset Match), the match's set boundaries are
 * authored rather than derived — a set force-ended at 18-12 is not something
 * replayTimeline could ever reconstruct from the events. Replaying such a match
 * would silently erase the override and its set history.
 *
 * So for an overridden match we reverse just the removed event's own point and
 * leave set state alone. The stat is still corrected and the running score
 * still moves; only the (no-longer-derivable) set boundaries are protected.
 *
 * The exception is an event carrying `completedSet`: that one DID move set
 * state, and reversing it against the (already zeroed) running score would undo
 * nothing while leaving the set banked. It gets the same banked-entry treatment
 * as the adjustment path — see lib/undo.ts reverseCompletingAction.
