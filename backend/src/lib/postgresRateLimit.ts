// Raw SQL rather than the generated client: the debit has to be one atomic
// read-lock-write per key, which a read-then-write through the model API cannot
// express without reopening the race this class exists to close.
//
// Two paths, one arithmetic. A single key (nearly every limiter) is one
// INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE ... WHERE statement: one round trip instead
// of an interactive transaction's four or five. Several keys (forgot-password:
// ip + email) keep the transaction, because one upsert decides each row on its
// own and so cannot make several keys all-or-nothing.
//
// Both rely on Postgres's default READ COMMITTED: there, ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE
// locks the existing row and evaluates SET/WHERE against its latest committed
// version, so debits on one key are serial. Under SERIALIZABLE (if the
// database default were ever changed) concurrent debits would instead fail
// with 40001, which lands in the catch below — the in-memory fallback, loud in
// Sentry, not a wrong count.
