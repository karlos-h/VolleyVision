/**
 * Team visibility model
 * ─────────────────────
 * Teams are always private to the people who belong to them. A team is visible
 * only to its owner, a user with an accepted TeamMembership on it, or a global
 * ADMIN. Everyone else is treated as if the team does not exist (404, not 403)
 * so a team's id is never leaked.
 *
 * There is no public-team concept — the previous `isPublic` flag was removed
 * along with public browsing.
 *
 * This helper is the single source of truth for that rule. It is enforced in
 * middleware (see middleware/visibility.ts) in front of every team-scoped read
 * endpoint, and reused by the team-list controller to filter results.
