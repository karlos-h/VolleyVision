# Deploys VolleyVision to Netlify (production by default, or staging) with an
# accurate deploy message, then runs the smoke check against what it deployed.
#
# Usage (from repo root):
#   .\deploy.ps1                      # prod; message auto-built from git state
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Target staging      # the staging site, using backend/.env.staging
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Message "hotfix x"  # explicit message override
#   .\deploy.ps1 -SkipMigrationCheck  # skip the pending-migrations check below
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Force               # prod from a dirty tree or a branch other than main
#   .\deploy.ps1 -NoBackup            # prod without today's backup.ps1 file
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Target staging -Migrate   # prisma migrate deploy against staging, then stop
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Target staging -Seed      # npm run db:seed:staging against staging, then stop
#   .\deploy.ps1 -Target staging -Draft     # a draft deploy (free: no --prod) at rehearse-<sha>--<site>.netlify.app
#
# The auto-built message is "<tag> (<sha>): <commit subject>", with a
# "+ uncommitted local changes" suffix when the working tree is dirty —
# so the Netlify Deploys list always says exactly what shipped.
#
# Before deploying, this script runs `npx prisma migrate status` from
# backend/ and aborts the deploy if migrations are pending or the database is
# unreachable. Pass -SkipMigrationCheck to bypass that check. For prod it reads
# backend/.env as before; for staging it loads backend/.env.staging into the
# environment for that step only (real environment variables override Prisma's
# own .env loading) and restores the environment afterwards.
#
# Prod refuses a dirty working tree or a branch other than main unless -Force:
# a prod deploy publishes the working tree, not a git ref. It also refuses
# unless today's backup (backup.ps1, $HOME\Backups\vv-backup-<today>-*.sql)
# exists and isn't empty, unless -NoBackup: the Supabase free plan keeps no
# downloadable backups, so that file is the only way back.
#
# After a successful deploy it runs backend/scripts/smoke.mjs: against prod
# with no credentials (read-only checks), against staging with the SMOKE_*
# values from backend/.env.staging (logs in as the seed users).
#
# -Draft (staging only, 9.5.0.8): on Netlify every production publish costs
# credits, the staging site's included; a draft deploy is free. It uploads the
# same local build without --prod, under the alias rehearse-<short sha>, and
# smoke-checks that draft URL. The SPA calls the relative /api/v1, which
# netlify.toml routes to the function on the same deploy, so the draft serves
# both from one origin (no CORS change). Env vars come from the site's
# dev/deploy-preview context; staging sets every value for all contexts.
#
# Notes:
# - Deploys build LOCALLY (--build) and publish the working tree, not a git
#   ref. --build is load-bearing: it runs netlify.toml's build command with
#   the site's env vars injected. Without it the CLI just uploads whatever
#   frontend/dist already holds, built against a shell that has no
#   VITE_SENTRY_DSN -- and since main.tsx guards Sentry.init on that var,
#   Vite tree-shakes the SDK out entirely and the frontend ships with no
#   error tracking at all, silently. Verified: the dist built that way
#   contains zero Sentry code.
# - Requires the Netlify CLI to be logged in as the himextradingltd
#   account (the KP Enterprise account can read the site but deploys 404).
# - If the schema changed, run `npx prisma migrate deploy` from backend/ first
#   (with backend/.env.staging loaded, for staging).
